    description: "The Volvo C30 was a three-door, front-engine, front-wheel-drive premium compact hatchback manufactured by Volvo Cars from 2006 to 2013. This pre-facelift model was built on the Ford C1/Volvo P1 platform shared with the S40 sedan, V50 wagon, and C70. The C30 drew styling inspiration from the classic Volvo P1800 ES with its distinctive frameless glass rear hatch and four individual seats. Engine options varied by market, including four and five-cylinder petrol and diesel engines, with power ranging from approximately 100 horsepower in the 1.6L engines to 230 horsepower in the T5 turbo variant. The interior featured Volvo's floating center console design, premium materials, and Scandinavian minimalism aesthetic. Throughout its production, the C30 positioned itself as a stylish, safety-focused premium hatchback alternative to competitors like the Audi A3 and BMW 1 Series."

    description: "The Volvo C30 received a significant facelift in early 2010 that redesigned the front fascia with a new grille and bumper, giving it a more modern appearance. New interior color combinations like Espresso/Blond were introduced, and optional features like an advanced start/stop function became available. The C30 continued to be built on the Ford C1/Volvo P1 platform with the same range of four and five-cylinder petrol and diesel engines. Despite winning the IIHS Top Safety Pick award, its unusual positioning as a premium three-door hatchback with limited practicality meant it remained a niche product. Production ended in 2013 without a direct replacement, though its design philosophy influenced later models including the C40 electric crossover coupe."
