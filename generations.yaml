    description: "The Volvo C30 was a compact three-door hatchback produced as a single generation from 2006 to 2013. Designed as a premium entry in the compact segment, it drew styling inspiration from the classic Volvo P1800 ES with its distinctive glass tailgate and two-plus-two seating arrangement. Built on Volvo's P1 platform shared with the S40 sedan and V50 wagon, the C30 featured a shorter wheelbase and overall length but maintained the same front-end design as its siblings. Engine options varied by market but included various four and five-cylinder petrol and diesel engines, with power outputs ranging from approximately 100 to 230 horsepower in the high-performance T5 model. The interior showcased Volvo's floating center console design, premium materials, and a focus on Swedish minimalism, with four individual seats rather than a traditional rear bench. A significant facelift in 2009 updated the front fascia with more angular headlights and a redesigned grille and bumper, while the rear received minor updates. Throughout its production, the C30 positioned itself as a stylish, safety-focused alternative to competitors like the Audi A3 and BMW 1 Series, though its unusual positioning as a premium three-door hatchback with limited practicality meant it remained a relatively niche product. Production ended in 2013 without a direct replacement, though elements of its distinctive design philosophy later influenced the Volvo C40 electric crossover coupe."
